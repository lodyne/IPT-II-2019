# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is simply the way to extract knowlegde from data.That is, the science to make machines learn from data 
in order to make decisions.
Machine Learning has become popular in recent years and has been applied from various fields such as:-

* The use of autonomous cars
* Automatic recommendation of movies to watch in Netflix
* Photo recognization
* Food recommendation during ordering

In short a lot of complex websites and softwares use machine learning at their core.

## Why Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) has become ubiquitous in our daily lives.It used in any industry you can imagine, form health care,
manufacturing, retail, banking and many more.

It helps to solve many problems which were tedious and infeasible long ago by replacing the use of control structures
(i.e. if - else statements).This is done by creating 'a model' which will be used to predict the outputs after been given
the corresponding inputs.

## Machine Learning problems

In order for Machine Learning model to be successful, it must be able to automate decision-making processes by 
generalizing from known examples/inputs.

There are various problems in which ML can solve including:-

### Supervised Machine Learning

``` ### Supervised Machine Learning

In which the user provides the algorithms with pairs of input data and desired outputs,
and the algorithm finds a way to produce desired output given a set of new inputs.
Eg of Supervised ML are Spam emails detection,Tumor detection and Fraud detection in credit card transactions.
```

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

```### Unsupervised Machine Learning

In which only the input data is known, and no known output is given to the algorithm.
Eg of Unsupervised ML are identifying topics in blog posts,customer's segmentation according to their preferences
and detecting abnormal access patterns in website.
```

## Why Python

Python is a programming language which is widely used in ML technology. This is because of the following reasons:-

* Python is General Purpose Language (i.e. it uses various programming paradigms such as OOP, functional and procedural).
* It is simple to learn and understand
* Python has great community support
* It is scripting and interpreted language (i.e. it doesnt need to be compiled)
* Python has got many libraries used in ML such as:-

1. **Numpy** - for data presentation in 2D and 3D
2. **Pandas** - for data anaysis
3. **Matplotlib** - for data visualization
4. **Scipy** -for numerical computation
5. **Scikit-Learn** -for implementation of ML algorithms

## Difference between Python 2 and Python 3

* Division operator
Eg:- 5/2 gives 2 in Python 2 but it gives 2.5 in Python 3.

* Print function
In Python 2 print function is written as print 'Hello' while in Python 3 it is written as print('Hello') with curly brackets.

* try and except blocks

### Python 2

```In Python 2

    try
        \\statement
    except NameError,err
        \\statement
```

### Python 3

```In Python 3

    try
        \\statement
    except NameError as err
        \\statement
```
