# SUPERRVISED MACHINE LEARNING

Supervised Machine Learning is used to predict a certain outcome from a given input.
Then from the given input/output data, a  machine learning model is built which will
comprise the training set.
The goal of creating the model is to make accurate predictions for new/never-before
seen data.
It usually requires human effort to build the training set, then the model automates
and speeds up a labourious or infeasible task.

## Types of Supervised Machine Learning

1.**Classification** -predict class model
2.**Regression** - predict continous number

## Generalization,Overfitting and Underfitting

The main goal of Supervised Machine Learning is to build a model on a training data which
will make accurate predictions of a new, never seen data that have the same characteristics
with the training data.

* **Generalization** occurs if the model is able to make accurate predictions on unseen data.
i.e. it is able to generalize from the training set to the test set.

* **Overfitting** occurs when building complex model too closely to the particularities of
the training set and obtain a model that works well on the training set but it is not be able
to generalize to new data.

* **Underfitting** occurs if the model is to simple and might not be able to capture all the
aspects of and variability on the data and thre model will do badly even on the traing set.
